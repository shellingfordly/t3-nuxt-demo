# Vue Comment

[WIP]

This is a issue-based vue-comment component. It‚Äòs inspiration comes in [vssue](https://github.com/meteorlxy/vssue).

It's incomplete now. If you config Github-OAuth config, and create first issue, you can view all comments and add comment of the issue.

The other person can sign in github. But he/she can't add comment, because the access_token can't support to post comment that return from "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token".
