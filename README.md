# Vue Comment

[WIP]

This is a issue-based vue-comment component. It‚Äòs inspiration comes in [vssue](https://github.com/meteorlxy/vssue).

It's incomplete now. If you config yourself github_token, and create first issue, you can view all comments and add comment of the issue.

The other person can sign in github. But he/she can't add comment by himself/herself, because comment-action based github_token of config.

## TodoList

Maybe it will realize similar functions to **vssue** in the future.

- [ ] get user auth
- [ ] add comment by user
- [ ] cancel reaction comment
- [x] reaction comment
- [x] show issue all comments
- [x] add comment only by oneself
